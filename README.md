# Mac Utils

This is a small collection of Java/Scala Mac OS X utilities.

Warning: Some of these methods haven't been tested yet. I just copied
and pasted them from some Java/Mac applications, and converted them to
Scala without adding tests yet. I'll add tests when I get some more free
time, but honestly, this isn't a high priority at the moment; I'm just
trying to organize a few things.
